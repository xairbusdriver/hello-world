# hello-world

Created a previous churches first web site. I no longer attend and that site was replaced by a template type.
Have two current web sites: mailscamalert.com and mid-southweather.com
Studying PHP and MySQL: Qualify as a beginner. Have created some PHP scripts for use in the weather site. My next project is to create a "Journal" containing more info and viewing choices that provided in the weather program that gathers data for that site.
